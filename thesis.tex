\section{Acknowledgements}

The body of work that follows tells a story of scientific achievement, highlighting the incremental progress others and I have made, but it neglects something far more important, the people and community behind it all. Throughout this journey I have had incredible support from friends, family, mentors, communities of fellow students and scientists, among many others. Without their help, support, and constant positive influence I would not be where I am now, nor would I be the person I am today.

Thank you, Albrecht, for your guidance, light-hearted takes, and sage advice. Your persistent input has helped me to become a better scientist and communicator, despite my own stubbornness at times. There is still much for me to learn, but I have you to thank for setting me on the right track and keeping me from getting lost in the metaphorical woods.

To Carlos, Tianlu, Juliana, and Nancy, we've struggled long and hard together, but I hope we all remember the fun we've had along the way.
You all have lit the fire beneath me, and I could not have made it through without you guys.

I've been fortunate to be surrounded by amazing people at WIPAC and couldn't ask for a better bunch of people as my friends and colleagues through these years.
Your positive attitudes, eagerness, and excitement have been absolutely contagious.
Beyond that I have been humbled by your generosity and selfless drive to improve the institutions that shape our lives.

My parents, Margaret and James, have been there to support me at every turn.
