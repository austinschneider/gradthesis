# of course specify the different media and the energy cut settings
# lines started with # are ignored
#
# After the keyword global you can specify the following options
#
# random number generator seed:
#       seed                1     (if not specified, default 1 (int))
#
# Bremsstrahlung parametrization

#
# To enable Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal supression of EM cross-sections give the following keyword
#       lpm
#
# To enable Moliere scattering give the following keyword
#       moliere
#
# To calculate the exact local time give the following keyword
#       exact_time
#
# You can give cross section multiplier to in- or decrease the cross sections
#       brems_multiplier    1     (if not specified, default 1 (double))
#       photo_multiplier    1     (if not specified, default 1 (double))

#
# If you want to disable the interpolation give the following keyword.
# Note: The needed cpu time will mostly rise to not workable amount of time
# and interpolation is accurate enough
#       integrate
#
# If a not empty path is given the interpolation tables will be safed
# Note: You should do so. This will decrease the initialization time a lot
# Note: You need write permission
#       path_to_tables      /path/to/tables
#
# Give the following keyword if you want to store tables in binary format
#       raw
#
# You can give default values for the energy cut settings for inside, infront and behind the detector
# and you can specify if the continous randomization option is enabled or not in these parts.
# (ecut is an absolute value: ecut =500 means that every energy loss > 500 MeV is treated stochasticaly)
# (vcut is a relative value : vcut =0.01 means that every energy loss > 0.01*particle_energy is treated stochasticaly)
# Note: If you specify those settings in the sector part for the indivdual media the values specified
# here will be overwritten.
# Note: If ecut = -1, vcut will be used. vcut = -1, ecut will be used. If both = -1 only continuous losses
# are taking into account.
