PROPOSAL was tested on Mac OS X V. 10.7.5, Ubuntu 12.04, SUSE Enterprise 10 and PCLinuxos. Since
all these OS are UNIX based it should be fine to run and compile PROPOSAL on a UNIX based OS.

Requirements:
	- Boost Library 1.48 or higher
	- log4cplus 	(http://sourceforge.net/p/log4cplus/wiki/Home/)
	- CMake 2.8 or higher	

Recommended:
	- Doxygen 	(For pdf and html documentation of the code)
	- GTEST 	(To be sure not to break program code if you change something)
	- ROOT		(This is highly recommended since there are lots of example plots
			 and you are able to save the output in an root file.)

-----How to Install:
1. Make a directory where the whole project will be (e.g. "PROPOSAL")
2. Extract the sources from the homepage to the folder (e.g. "PROPOSAL/PROPOSALsrc")
3. Create and move to a build directory in the main folder (here "PROPOSAL/build")
4. Do
	cmake source_folder (e.g. "cmake ../PROPOSALsrc")
5. Do
	make (hint: "make -j#" will make the project with # processors simultaneous.)

-----Usage:
You can execute the PROPOSAL main from from the build directory. (e.g. "./bin/PROPOSALtest")
The main part of the configuration of the propagator routine are the configuration files which
you can find in resources. The file is fully documented and should guide you through your configuration.
Even if you haven't installed root you should find some interesting code in the root_examples.
All particle coordinates take the detector as the origin of the coordinate system.
