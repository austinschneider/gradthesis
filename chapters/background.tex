\section{Cosmic rays and air showers}

Cosmic rays are high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that propagate through space.
Around $\SI{90}\percent$ of cosmic rays we observe are protons, with a smaller proportion of alpha particles, and less than $\SI{1}\percent$ which are heavy nuclei~\cite{Gaisser:2016uoy}.
Most cosmic rays originate from outside our solar system, but within our galaxy.
Increased solar activity has been shown to inversely correlate with the majority of cosmic ray observations, which can be understood as an exclusion from our stellar neighborhood by the magnetized solar wind.
The bulk of cosmic rays have gyro-radii small enough that they are contained in the Milky-Way by galactic magnetic fields.
Additionally, measurements of gamma rays at the energies relevant for neutral pion decay show a spatial distribution consistent with a galactic population of cosmic rays.
If the bulk of cosmic rays were of extra-galactic origin we would expect neutral pions to be produced in abundance within intergalactic space, and this is not supported by the gamma-ray measurements~\cite{Abdo:2009mr}.
In fact, the peak of the gamma-ray spectrum from neutral-pion decay is observed with galactic gamma-ray data in the $\sim\SI{70}\MeV-\SI{40}\GeV$ energy range, and accurately predicts the measured cosmic ray spectrum in the $\sim\SI{200}\MeV-\SI{100}\GeV$ energy range~\cite{Dermer:2013iwa}.

Observations of the relative proportions of primary and secondary nuclei suggest that cosmic rays on average traverse distances thousands of times greater than the thickness of the galactic disk before reaching Earth.
This proportion of secondary nuclei decreases with energy, meaning that particles of higher energy traverse less material on average before reaching us.
We expect this trend if acceleration and propagation are separate processes that occur on different timescales.
For this reason we believe cosmic rays to be accelerated by dense astrophysical objects and then subsequently diffused by propagation through the interstellar medium.
Simultaneous propagation and acceleration also fails because the timescale to accelerate cosmic rays to their observed energy is greater than the age of the galaxy in such a scenario.
While the acceleration mechanisms and particular sources of cosmic rays are unknown, we can narrow the candidates to astrophysical objects that are large or have strong magnetic fields.

A small proportion of cosmic rays have been observed in excess of $\SI{1e19}\eV$.
At these energies, cosmic rays cannot be sufficiently bound by the galactic magnetic field to produce an isotropic flux.
Thus, cosmic rays at this energy scale must either point towards nearby accelerators or arrive roughly isotropically from extra-galactic sources.
The spectrum and spatial distribution of this highest energy population has been shown as distinct from the lower-energy population and likely to be of extra-galactic origin.
The sources and acceleration mechanisms of these extra-galactic cosmic rays are unknown to date.
This remains a subject of significant study and interest, in particular because much more extreme environments are required for acceleration to these energies.
An simple energetic consideration tells us that the maximum energy achievable through acceleration by an object with size $R$ and magnetic field strength $B$ is $E<ecBR$.
Tighter constraints on the maximum energy can be derived when considering diffusive shock acceleration specifically.
This limit is effectively summarized by the Hillas diagram, which compares the size and magnetic field strength of various objects to the upper limit on cosmic ray energy.
Figure~\ref{fig:hillasp20} shows this limit for $\SI{1e20}\eV$ protons considering various acceleration scenarios and energy losses.
Clearly there are many candidates for cosmic-ray production, and narrowing the field may require another approach.

Cosmic rays can be observed interacting in the Earth's atmosphere, as they produce extensive particle air-showers whose constituents and products can be observed with a wide range of techniques.
The charged particle products of these interactions have been observed as early as 1912~\cite{hess1912uber}.
These air showers are of particular concern to neutrino detectors as they produce high-energy muons and neutrinos in relative abundance, both of which can be observed by neutrino detectors even with significant shielding and overburden.

When cosmic rays interact with the atmosphere some nuclear fragments can be produced, but hadronization occurs due to the high energy of the incident cosmic ray and initiates a hadronic particle shower.
As part of the hadronic shower, pions and kaons are produced in abundance.
These subsequently decay or interact in the low-density atmosphere.
Leptonic and semi-leptonic decays of charged pions and kaons that produce muons or neutrinos have a large decay branching fraction, resulting in an abundance of muons and neutrinos in any air shower that begins hadronically.
Decays of charged pions
%($\pi^+\rightarrow\mu^+\nu_\mu$, $\pi^+\rightarrow\mu^+\bar{\nu}_e$, $\pi^+\rightarrow\mu^+\nu_e$, $\pi^+\rightarrow\mu^+\nu_\mu \gamma$, $\pi^+\rightarrow e^+\nu_e$),
($\pi^+\rightarrow\mu^+\nu_\mu$), 
%$K_L^0$ ($K_L^0 \rightarrow \pi^\pm e^\mp \nu_e$, $K_L^0 \rightarrow \pi^\pm \mu^\mp \nu_\mu$), and 
$K_L^0$ ($K_L^0 \rightarrow \pi^\pm e^\mp \nu_e$, $K_L^0 \rightarrow \pi^\pm \mu^\mp \nu_\mu$), and 
%$K^+$ ($K^+\rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu$, $K^+\rightarrow \pi^0 e^+ \nu_e$, $K^+\rightarrow \pi^0 \mu^+ \nu_\mu$, $K^+\rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu \gamma$) 
$K^+$ ($K^+\rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu$, $K^+\rightarrow \pi^0 e^+ \nu_e$, $K^+\rightarrow \pi^0 \mu^+ \nu_\mu$) 
all have direct contributions to the muon and neutrino fluxes; secondary contributions from pion production in kaon decay are also present, particularly for $K_S^0$.
The yield of muons and neutrinos is highly zenith dependent.
This is a result of the interplay between the probability for meson interaction and meson decay.
Unlike those that decay, pions and kaons that interact with the atmosphere or Earth will not produce neutrinos, and decay is much more likely in the low-density atmosphere.
Between the zenith and horizon the average path length of mesons through the atmosphere increases with zenith angle, thereby increasing the yield of neutrinos for the same flux of cosmic rays.
For this reason, neutrino production from pions and kaons is peaked at the horizon as shown in \reffig{fig:atmo_zenith}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/atm_flux}
	\internallinenumbers
	\caption{\textbf{\textit{Production of atmospheric muon neutrinos.}}
		The atmospheric muon neutrino flux at the Earth's surface is plotted as a function of the zenith angle as measured with respect to the IceCube detector center.
		At these high energies above several $\si\TeV$ the production of muon neutrinos is dominated by kaon decays.
		The kaon and pion production is peaked at the horizon where the path of these particles includes the longest stretch of atmosphere before reaching the Earth.
		This results in a higher decay probability for these mesons.
		Production from the prompt decay of charmed hadrons has no angular dependence as the decay length of these hadrons is short with respect to the atmosphere for all directions.
	}\label{fig:atmo_zenith}
\end{figure}

Neutrinos can also be produced by charmed hadrons present in air showers.
These hadrons are much shorter lived than the pion and kaon, and almost invariably decay before interaction.
As the interaction probability for these charmed hadrons is so low, the production of neutrinos from them has practically no dependence on the zenith angle.
This flux of neutrinos has yet to be observed, although it's spectrum has been predicted ($\sim E^{-2.7}$) and constraints have been placed on its normalization.
As this atmospheric flux is effectively isotropic some have suggested that it may be confused for the astrophysical flux.
However, the astrophysical flux can be distinguished by its energy spectrum and by the effect described in \refsec{sec:passingfractions}.

Muons produced in these air showers reach the ground where they can be detected, and often penetrate many kilometers into the Earth's surface.
Underground neutrino detectors can therefore be sensitive to muon backgrounds despite large overburdens of rock, water, or ice.
Neutrinos, on the other hand, have a small interaction cross such that the effective area for neutrinos is approximately $10^6$ times smaller than that for similar energy muons in the few $\si\TeV$ energy regime.
With this small interaction cross section, neutrinos are likely to pass through the Earth without interacting.
This means neutrino detectors are able to observe the atmospheric neutrino flux coming from all directions.
Chapter~\ref{chapter:backgrounds} explores in detail how these backgrounds are estimated for IceCube.

\section{Neutrino interactions and detection}

Neutrinos are the only neutral leptons in the standard model of particle physics.
Although fundamentally neutrinos only interact through gravity and the exchange of weak bosons, there exist a wide range of processes that dominate the relevant physical behavior of neutrinos at different energy scales.
Such interactions include: nuclear capture, inverse beta-decay, quasi-elastic scattering, resonant particle production, coherent elastic scattering, deep inelastic scattering (DIS), and ultra-high energy interactions~\cite{Vannucci:2017rqs,Akimov:2017ade}.
Above $\si\TeV$ neutrino energies however, only two known processes remain relevant for detection: DIS and resonant $W$ production.
Deep inelastic scattering refers to processes that probe the fundamental components of hadrons.
For neutrinos, this means the exchange of a weak boson with a quark.
The momentum imparted to the quark will produce a hadronic cascade of secondary particles.
The details of the lepton side of the interaction depend heavily on the species of incident neutrino and weak boson exchanged.
We can divide these DIS interactions into two categories based on the weak boson exchanged.
Interactions involving the exchange of a $Z^0$ are referred to as ``neutral current'' (NC), and those exchanging a $W^+$ or $W^-$ are referred to as ``charged current'' (CC).
Modern techniques for observing neutrino interactions rely on detecting the charged particle products of the initial interaction.
As a consequence of this, the observable energy can be very different for NC and CC events.
Both interactions produce a hadronic cascade, but on the leptonic side of the interaction NC events have an outgoing neutrino (not observable) while CC events have an outgoing charged lepton (observable).
These two interactions are shown in \reffig{fig:DIS}.

	Interactions of the CC variety on the other hand, produce a charged lepton in addition to the hadronic cascade.

	\label{fig:DIS}
\end{figure}

The third interaction relevant above $\si\TeV$ neutrino energies is the resonant production of a $W$ boson, otherwise known as the Glashow resonance (GR)~\cite{Glashow:1960zz}.
In matter on Earth this process occurs when an anti-electron neutrino combines with an atomic electron to produce an on-shell $W^+$ as shown in~\reffig{fig:glashow}.
If we consider the rest frame of the electron, then this resonance occurs at a neutrino energy of $\SI{6.3}\PeV$.
For atomic electrons we should consider the rest frame of the atom, and in this case there is a Doppler broadening of the resonance of $\sim\SI{20}\percent$ due to the orbital motion of the electrons~\cite{Loewy:2014zva}.
In practice this broadening is small in comparison to the energy resolution of modern neutrino detectors that have access to this energy scale, and any further broadening from thermal motion will be even smaller.
The production of a $W^+$ and it's subsequent decay can result in either a hadronic shower similar to a NC interaction, or a leptonic final state similar to a CC interaction.
These two possibilities correspond to the hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the $W$ respectively.

The cross section of these processes is shown as a function of the neutrino energy in \reffig{fig:nuxs}.
The growth of the cross section with energy counteracts the falling neutrino spectrum to only a small degree.
Depsite the large crosss section, only a few Glashow resonance events are expected in $\SI{10}\year$ of IceCube detector operation as result of the comparably low neutrino flux at these energies.
Absorption of neutrinos in the Earth becomes significant above $\sim\SI{1}\TeV$, and is notably peaked near the $\SI{6.3}\PeV$ resonance energy.

Through either a NC interaction or the hadronic decay of a $W$ boson, neutrinos can induce a hadronic shower.
In a hadronic shower, both charged hadrons and leptons are produced which can be detected through well established methods.
Charged current interactions produce a hadronic shower by imparting momentum to a quark which is then hadronized, although the charged lepton produced in the interaction is also detectable and can significantly alter the detection signature of the event.

Through either a CC interaction or the leptonic decay of a $W$ boson, neutrinos can produce a detectable charged lepton, although the detection signature differs depending on the flavor of charged lepton produced.
Focusing on dense detection media like ice or water, the detection signatures of the three flavors of charged leptons are as follows.
High energy electrons and positrons immediately interact with the detection media to initiate an electromagnetic cascade where charged leptons and high energy photons are alternately produced by one another.
This electromagnetic cascade develops over $\sim10$ radiation lengths (about $\sim\SI{5}\m$ in total) at $\SI{10}\TeV$ with a lateral extension of $\sim\SI{20}\cm$ (twice the Molière radius), expanding within the dense detection medium, and has a extreme directional bias because of the momentum of the first charged lepton.

Muons from high energy neutrino interactions do not interact as readily as electrons and positrons due to their larger mass.
Instead, muons are able to travel several kilometers in dense media before eventually losing enough energy that they quickly decay.
Along their entire path length, muons lose energy by interacting with the detection medium.
These ``energy loss'' interactions include ionization, electron-positron pair production, bremsstrahlung, and photo-nuclear interactions.
Although these processes are highly stochastic, the average energy loss of muons approximately follows $-dE/dx=a+bE$ where $a$ is determined by the ionization energy losses and $b$ is defined by the other processes.
In general $a$ and $b$ are both functions of the muon energy $E$, but this linear approximation where $a$ and $b$ are constant holds locally as both are slowly varying as a function of $E$.
For muon energies above $\SI{1}\TeV$, the so called ``radiative'' term $bE$ dominates the average energy losses.
Figure~\ref{fig:energy_losses} shows the energy loss rate for the different processes.
Once the radiative losses have taken over above $\sim\SI{1}\TeV$, the losses grow exponentially with energy.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/energy_losses}
	\internallinenumbers
	\caption{\textbf{\textit{Muon Energy Losses}}
		The muon energy loss rate computed for water is plotted as a function of the muon energy for the five different loss processes.
		This figure is reproduced here from~\cite{Koehne:2013gpa}.
		Radiative energy losses dominate above $\sim\SI{1}\TeV$.
		Although it is a smaller contribution to the energy losses, photo-nuclear interactions are the main source of uncertainty above $\sim\SI{1}\TeV$.
	}\label{fig:energy_losses}
\end{figure}

The strong dependence of the energy loss rate on muon energy means that the energy lost while traversing the detector can be used to estimate a muon's energy.
For simple observables like the total energy lost over $\SI{1}\km$ the stochastic energy losses introduce large variations between muons of the same energy, reducing their power as a proxy for the muon energy.
Figure~\ref{fig:muon_energy} shows the energy of muons lost within $\SI{1}\km$ of ice; a distribution with very long tails.
In practice the muon energy can currently be determined to within a factor of $2$, however improved techniques that take advantage of more detailed information may achieve a resolution as small as $\SI{10}\percent$ in the future.

	For each initial muon energy, the MAP and $\SI{90}\percent$ HPD region are plotted here.
	There is a strong correlation between the initial energy and energy lost.
	However, the distribution has very long tails, making a precise determination of the muon energy based on this observable impossible.
	Below a few hundred $\si\GeV$ muons lose all of their energy within $\SI{1}\km$ of ice, narrowing the distribution of $\Delta E$.
	}\label{fig:muon_energy}
\end{figure}

Taus produced through a CC interaction or the leptonic decay of a $W$ boson are also detectable.
The short decay length of a tau, $\SI{50}\meter / \si\PeV$, means it is likely to decay very close to the neutrino interaction vertex.
Taus decay hadronically with a branching ratio of $\SI{64.79}\percent$, which results in a hadronic shower.
Leptonic decay modes of the tau are decay to a charged lepton and corresponding neutrino of either electron or muon flavor.
In the electron case, an electromagnetic shower results; whereas in the muon case a far traveling muon is produced.
For taus produced via the decay of a $W$ boson, the event is indistinguishable from taus produces via CC and NC interactions other than by the resonance energy at which this process occurs.
Although a tau may traverse tens of meters, which is detectable by IceCube, the energy losses are still negligible over these distances.

From the wide variety of methods for detecting charged particles, water Cherenkov detectors are most common for detecting neutrinos in this high-energy regime above $\SI{1}\TeV$.
Water Cherenkov detectors have the advantage that their detection medium is both abundant and inexpensive, a major motivator in the design of IceCube.
Cherenkov radiation is the result of charged particles propagating through a dielectric medium faster than the phase velocity of light.
As charged particles pass through dielectric material, the ionization of the medium induces the emission of light.
For particles faster than the phase velocity of emitted light, the emission forms a conical coherent wave front at a well defined angle to the particle's path.

	}\label{fig:cherenkov}
\end{figure}

These detectors use Cherenkov radiation to detect particles, but the high-energy secondary charged leptons themselves contribute only a small fraction of the Cherenkov photons.
Most of the Cherenkov photons are produced by the tertiary particle showers that these leptons give rise to when they lose energy in the detection medium.
This increased light-yield allows detectors to be sparsely instrumented while maintaining detection efficiency and reconstruction quality.

Water Cherenkov detectors often make use of photo-multiplier-tubes (PMTs) to detect Cherenkov photons.
PMTs have a thin photo-cathode that is held at a high-voltage differential with respect to an anode; this allows the production and acceleration of a photo-electron when photons pass through the photo-cathode.
Accelerated photo-electrons hurtle towards an amplification stage composed of many dynodes, each held at a large voltage difference to the adjacent dynodes.
This setup allows a single photo-electron to produce many secondary electrons upon interaction with a dynode, starting an exponential cascade of electrons across the dynode stages.
The resulting cascade of electrons is amplified with respect to the original signal enough that they can be detected electronically as a voltage change.
In this way, PMTs can be sensitive to single photons, provided one is able to reach the photo-cathode and produce a photo-electron.
