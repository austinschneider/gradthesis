\chapter{Analysis}\label{chapter:analysis}

The goal of the analysis in this chapter is to characterize the astrophysical neutrino spectrum using a high-purity sample of events.
On its own, this may not provide the great insight that we desire into larger problems of astropysical neutrino origin or cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms.
However, the detailed measurements performed here are a vital piece of the puzzle that may help us to answer these larger questions in the long run.
In pursuit of these measurements a handful of new techniques were also developed, and these will certainly improve the other measurements we make going forward.
This chapter combines the analysis components outlined in previous chapters with different definitions of the astrophysical neutrino flux and applies the statistical inference techniques of \refsec{sec:statistics} to the analysis structure of \reffig{fig:analysis_overview}.
With this a wide variety of tests and measurements of the astrophysical flux are explored and their results examined.
