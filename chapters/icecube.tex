\section{Neutrino interactions and detection}

\textbf{What interactions do neutrinos have?}
Neutrinos are the only neutral leptons in the standard model of particle physics, interacting only through the weak force and gravity.

\textbf{How do these interactions manifest at different energy scales?}
Although fundamentally neutrinos only interact through the exchange of weak bosons, there exist a wide range of processes that dominate the relevant physical behavior of neutrinos at different energy scales.
Such interactions include: nuclear capture, inverse beta-decay, quasi-elastic scattering, resonant particle production, coherent elastic scattering, deep inelastic scattering (DIS), and ultra-high energy interactions~\ref{Vannucci:2017rqs,Akimov:2017ade}.
Above $\si\TeV$ neutrino energies however, only two known processes remain relevant for detection: DIS and resonant W production.


\textbf{What are the products from the neutrino interactions that allow us to detect neutrinos?}

\textbf{What is the process by which we detect these products in existing detectors?}
