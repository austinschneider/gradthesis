\section{Next steps}
The analysis presented here updated previous studies of the HESE sample, and is only a small part of the picture for astophysical neutrinos and the mystery of cosmic ray origin.
However, the techniques and solutions developed here remain broadly applicable to future analyses, and will enable more precise measurements as more data is accumulated and additional samples are developed.

From the perspective of analyzing the astrophysical neutrino flux...
