\setabstract{The IceCube neutrino observatory has established the existence of a high-energy isotropic neutrino flux of astrophysical origin. This discovery was made using events interacting within a fiducial region of the detector surrounded by an active veto with reconstructed energy above $\SI{60}\TeV$, commonly known as the high-energy starting event sample or HESE. We perform a complete revisit of the HESE sample with an additional $\SI{4.5}\year$ of data, newer glacial ice models, and improved systematics treatment. This paper gives a detailed description of the sample, reports on the latest astrophysical neutrino flux measurements, and presents a source search for astrophysical neutrinos. We give the compatibility of these observations with detailed isotropic flux models proposed in the literature as well as generic power-law-like scenarios. We find that the astrophysical spectrum, when assumed equal for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and among neutrino flavors, is compatible with an unbroken power law, with a preferred spectral index of $2.88^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$ for the $\SI{68.3}\percent$ confidence interval.}
